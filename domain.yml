Then, use your hands to shape it into a bowl. Put the dough into the fridge for about 30 minutes until it is firm. Afterwards let it rest and do not roll it out until the fruit has finished cooking.
  utter_r7d:

To release the tarte from the pan use a kitchen knife and run it through the edges. Then place a large plate over the pan and, using oven mitts to protect you from burning yourself, flip the tarte over on the plate. Enjoy your meal

  utter_r10c:
  - text: Okay let’s begin. For this recipe you will need mangos, there are two options for ingredients. You could either use frozen mangos or fresh mangoes. I recommend that, unless your mangoes are very fresh, you use frozen ones. Whatever your choice is, take 32 ounces of frozen mango and let them melt or 8 very fresh mangos. Then put them into the bowl of a food processor and process until it becomes a very smooth puree. This should take about 3 minutes. Take the mango puree and put it into a bowl; set it aside.

Pulse the food processor several times in short bursts until it's all broken into small pieces but not pureed. When this is done take the mixture and add it into a large saucepan, and turn the heat on to medium.
  utter_r10f:

Cook the mixture over medium heat until it starts to bubble. This should take around 5-10 minutes. Add ¼ of a cup of water to the sauce and combine. Depending on the texture that you want you could use a fine-mesh cloth and strain the sauce onto a food container or vary the water quantities. When you are happy with the consistency of the sauce, transfer it into a jar using a funnel. Enjoy your meal!
